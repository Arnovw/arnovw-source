This is index 0. An invocation for a new beginning. A first step on a new journey. 
An attempt to correct my imbalance between consumption and creation.

Browsing [hackernews](https://news.ycombinator.com/) has been a favourite pastime for a long time. 
Reading technical articles about new tools, ideas, techniques, tips, cool trivia, etc. keeps one engaged and learning new things.
And as a programmer it is essential to keep up to date with industry trends. 
But it is also important to view change on a larger backdrop of evolution.
It feels like technology is moving at a breakneck speed when you try to keep up with "everything".
But the fundamentals rarely change overnight. 

I've carved out this small part of internet real-estate to write about technical topics that are keeping me engaged.
Stick with me, maybe you'll find something useful ;)
